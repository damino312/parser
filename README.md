# parser
My course work where I should make a parser that parses some information from a site. I chose to parse cryptocurrancy on https://coinmarketcap.com/.

<p>FRONT-END: react, tailwind, axios, recharts, module architecture </p>
<p>BACK-END: express, mongoose, cors, mongodb.</p>
<p>PARSER: mongodb, axios, cheerio, mongoose.</p>


To run the project you need:
1. Download docker, docker-compose, hodejs, npm
2. Change the link to backend by a path front-source/src/main.jsx (default http://localhost:4000) and run "npm run build" to build front-end files.
3. Adjust docker-compose file according to you preferences
4. Run docker-compose up -d
